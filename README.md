# Random Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Java program that allows users to play a random number guessing game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess the number by entering their guesses. The game provides hints by informing the user whether their guess is too big or too small. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the random number.

## How to run the program

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html).
2. Save the code in a file called `RandomNumber.java`.
3. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `RandomNumber.java` file is located.
4. Compile the program by running the following command: `javac RandomNumber.java`.
5. Run the compiled program with the following command: `java RandomNumber`.

## How to play the game

1. When prompted, enter your guess as a whole number between 1 and 100.
2. The game will inform you whether your guess is too big or too small.
3. Keep guessing until you find the correct number. The game will then inform you that you have won.
4. After winning a round, you can choose to play another round or exit the game by entering 'y' or 'n', respectively.
